### Books

**[The DevOps Handbook, Gene Kim and Others](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Kim's DevOps Handbook presents itself as a solid guide to get a comprehensive understanding of the state of DevOps. The book presents itself as a wide variety of topics with real case studies baked into each chapter. While it doesn't get into the specifics, it builds a great overall understanding and allows the reader to gain an understanding of the landscape of devops.

**[The Creative Act: A Way Of Being, Rick Rubin](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Taking a break from technical related topics, Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act" presents itself as a different view of the world around us. Much of the book revolves around how we can discover the creativity around and within us. A significantly different perspective, but will defenitely leave you thinking about things in a different angle.

### Longform Reads

**[Alone at the Edge of the World, Cassidy Randall](https://magazine.atavist.com/alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world-susie-goodall-sailing-golden-globe-race/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Captivating read from beginning to end. Tells about the tale of Susie Goodall sailing around the world in a "small red-hulled sailboat." Around a 30 minute read but worth every minute.
