### Books

**[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=asc_df_0465050654/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693630454234&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6478094397919394984&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9005888&hvtargid=pla-416263148589&psc=1&mcid=7a0715432f8537eebf305578a025ace8&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693630454234&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6478094397919394984&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9005888&hvtargid=pla-416263148589&psc=1)**

From a technical background, I never quite got a grasp (or formal training) on creating the perfect user experience (UX). However, this book provides a wonderful and easy-to-digest overview of the different concepts within the UX world. Much of the book introduced new concepts to me such as user discovery, affordance, and design thinking which allow me to bring these concepts into my day to day work.

<!-- **[The Creative Act: A Way Of Being, Rick Rubin](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Taking a break from technical related topics, Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act" presents itself as a different view of the world around us. Much of the book revolves around how we can discover the creativity around and within us. A significantly different perspective, but will defenitely leave you thinking about things in a different angle.

### Longform Reads

I'm not currently reading any Longform articles. Check back for more! 

<!-- **[Alone at the Edge of the World, Cassidy Randall](https://magazine.atavist.com/alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world-susie-goodall-sailing-golden-globe-race/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Captivating read from beginning to end. Tells about the tale of Susie Goodall sailing around the world in a "small red-hulled sailboat." Around a 30 minute read but worth every minute.
