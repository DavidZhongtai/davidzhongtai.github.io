title = "About Me"
+++

I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign with a B.S. in Mathematics, finishing my degree in two years (2021-2023). During that time, I organized and hosted many events catered to undergraduates in the topics of recruiting, job search, and extracurriculars. I enjoy traveling to mentor and judge hackathons at different universities while continuing to give workshops and talks around the East Coast. I tinker with large database systems, text mining, and computer security in my spare time
