### Abstract
With the large and growing body of cyber risk literature, we see three major challenges faced by the actuarial research community: there is no context aware tool for finding cyber literature, no central repository of cyber risk resources, and a lack of accounting of literature trends. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose to build a repository of cyber-risk articles with an NLP powered search tool that can easily be used by researchers to find relevant materials.

### Goals
- Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify and group cyber-risk and cybersecurity related academic literature. Using this information, we want to construct a tool for academics and researchers to use to identify trends and new technologies in cyber-risk and cyber security.

- For example, given a text query, a researcher would be able to obtain relevant pieces of literature and topics to use as well as visualize trends and different topic groupings.

- In addition to that, researchers would be able to suggest and add new pieces of literature into the database as well. This would be a growing repository.

### Takeaways
- In the real world, data is never clean.
