### Technical Books

**[The DevOps Handbook, Gene Kim and Others](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Kim's DevOps Handbook presents itself as a solid guide to get a comprehensive understanding of the state of DevOps. The book presents itself as a wide variety of topics with real case studies baked into each chapter. While it doesn't get into the specifics, it builds a great overall understanding and allows the reader to gain an understanding of the landscape of devops.

**[Building Microservices, Sam Newman](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1492034029/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_1/146-3531637-3688721?pd_rd_w=yXzH5&content-id=amzn1.sym.1ad2066f-97d2-4731-9356-36b3edf1ae04&pf_rd_p=1ad2066f-97d2-4731-9356-36b3edf1ae04&pf_rd_r=NYTHHXKVHS0HQK4BCNMA&pd_rd_wg=9rOF3&pd_rd_r=571decc1-0fd5-4316-82c8-1e409fb59619&pd_rd_i=1492034029&psc=1)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Thought this was a really good (albeit short) book on the basics of building microservice applications. The book covered alot of relevant topics related to scoping, designing, deploying these microservices and also covers some of the "people capital" when scoping projects. Overall a nice read that doesn't get too heavily technical and "into the weeds"

**[Robust Python, Patrick Viafore](https://www.amazon.com/Robust-Python-Write-Clean-Maintainable/dp/1098100662)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
The title "Robust Python" is as descriptive as it gets. The book dives into multiple techniques to make Python much "stronger" while also coding defensively. Parts II and III start discussing user-defined types and some of the nuances surrounding those concepts. In addition to that, it covers topics in OOP in Python as well. Finally, in section IV of the book, Viafore discusses testing strategies such as Test Driven Development (TDD) and introduces concepts such as the testing pyramid and different testing methodologies.

### Other Books

**[The Creative Act: A Way Of Being, Rick Rubin](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717356/the-creative-act-by-rick-rubin/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Taking a break from technical related topics, Rick Rubin's "The Creative Act" presents itself as a different view of the world around us. Much of the book revolves around how we can discover the creativity around and within us. A significantly different perspective, but will defenitely leave you thinking about things in a different angle.

### Longform Reads + Blog Posts

**[Alone at the Edge of the World, Cassidy Randall](https://magazine.atavist.com/alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world-susie-goodall-sailing-golden-globe-race/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Captivating read from beginning to end. Tells about the tale of Susie Goodall sailing around the world in a "small red-hulled sailboat." Around a 30 minute read but worth every minute.

**[(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/)**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
This was a cool article about the different technology stacks and processes someone used during startups. Relates significantly with alot of the Devops content inside of the reading list.
