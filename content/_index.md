I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Mathematics. I work with large database systems and text mining. Over Summer 2022, I worked as a [Data Science Intern @ Ameren](/professional/ameren). Before that, I interned as a Business Analyst @ ASA D.Next Lab. Check out my [blog](/blog) where I write about research and excursions into different topics
