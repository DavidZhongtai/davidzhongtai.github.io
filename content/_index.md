## Hi, I'm David!

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I study Mathematics. I have had experience working with large database systems, text mining, and data visualization. Over Summer 2022, I worked as a [Data Science Intern @ Ameren](/professional/ameren). Before that, I interned as a [Business Analyst @ American Supply Association D.Next Lab](/professional/asa) during 2021-2022.
