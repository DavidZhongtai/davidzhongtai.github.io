# Life For the Past 3 Months

It's been 2.5 months since I graduated, and approximately 3-ish months since the last computer or mathematical related post. While alot has gone on, there will definitely be a steady catch up of content that has been written but not yet uploaded. After settling down and moving, there should be much more time to write. In lieu of that however, there has been alot of time to do cool things and catch up with people since then. 

***Some short things lately:*** 

- In May, I ended up in the ER after a bike crash during finals week ðŸ¤ 

- In that same May, I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and started working full time at Red Cell Partners

- I finished up my honors project studying the graphical representation of polynomials in the complex plane and will put some small fun writeup on it soon! While you can read the [paper here](/paper.pdf), I plan on making it much more accessible and interactive in a future writeup. 

***On the fun computer stuff:***

- I recently had the pleasure of helping organize [UIUCTF23](https://2023.uiuc.tf) with an awesome (and extremely talented) group of [people](https://2023.uiuc.tf) in July. I was responsible for helping develop the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) suite of challenges. I can't wait to travel back to campus in September for FallCTF 2023, SIGPwny's CTF challenge for beginners and teach more about OSINT. 

- Shoutout to Charlotte ([@charlotte-fondren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-fondren/)) for showing me AWS certifications. I took bias for action and became a certified Solutions Architect Associate!!

- Me and Monica ([@monica-para](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-para/)) recently launched [CareersPrep.io](https://careersprep.io) to help consolidate resources and opportunities for other students in new grad and internship recruiting. We can't wait to take this and our experience/knowledge in front of bigger audiences in the fall!! 

***What's next:*** 
- In early September, I'm travelling to the University of Pennsylvania to be a mentor their hackathon: PennApps. In late September, I'm heading up north to Boston to be a judge at HackMIT. Extremely excited for both of those opportunities. 

- Travel with friends and family :O

I'll be steadily catching up all the content from May-July so stay tuned for that with the first being my writeup and solutions from UIUCTF23!!
