# Inequality Fun and Their Applications (WIP)

Article is in WIP. This article assumes the reader has basic knowledge of calculus, analysis, and statistics. Covers topics ranging from basic Cauchy Schwarz to Lipschitz, culminating in us pulling out a mathematical rabbit out of an algebraic hat.

## 1. What is an Inequality?

An inequality compares two values, showing if one is less than, greater than, or simply not equal to another value. Literally, it does not get more simpler than that. For example: \\(3 \leq 5\\) directly reads "3 is less than or equal to 5." Whereas \\(14 \geq 2\\) reads "14 is greater than or equal to 2."
