# 1 Month and 7 Cities Later 

Flights start blending together one after one. Washington D.C. used to seem like a world away but now is a quick afternoon drive. Early morning drives to the airport only to make it through security before the sun rises and the Dunkin' opens. A mad scramble to the front of the line when boarding starts, all to claim the best overhead bin space. 

Those lines have described the past month making my way around the east coast. I really should have been home, but something in me can't just stay in one place at a time. Many of the stops were to revisit old spots and friends. 

A stop at Stamford to revisit memories made during summer, another in NYC to spend time with family on Labor Day, and a quick jaunt around Back Bay--an upscale area in a part of downtown Boston. Feeling the train slow down, I haul my suitcase down from the overhead compartment. Covered in dents, scratches, and grease marks, the silver of the suitcase looks as sleek as ever in the afternoon sunlight as I make my way to the airport.

Boarding a plane in DC, I'm currently on my way to Illinois to visit some college friends. Having been on the road for 7 days already, the glamour of perpetual travel has started to wear off a bit as I long for a home-cooked meal. 

Since graduating from college in May, I suddenly find myself with an abundance of time. Class schedules no longer exist, leaving a void in a what-used-to be orderly day-to-day schedule. From 9 to 5, I envelop myself in work, oblivious to what is going on outside. From 5 to 9, I make my way over to the late night burger joint, or an Amtrak, going hundreds of miles away from where I currently am. Many people talk about settling down or taking a break after college, and I ask myself why I haven't done the same. 

The flight attendants start the ritual of going around, checking everyone's seatbelts, and making sure devices are put into airplane mode. Shortly after, we take off. Some small talk with my seatmate and we both settle in our own rhythms and business. 

At first, going solo into a large airport is intimidating with not much room for thought; the only one thought being how to get to the destination. Subsequent trips become much easier. TSA goes from being a scary entity to being a minor inconvenience to get through. You learn to embrace the tradition of scarfing down Mickey-D's right before a flight or scrambling to catch a last-minute gate change. 

Traveling by air, rail, road, you tend to encounter a wide variety of people and perspectives. There's something unique about meeting someone for a few hours and then parting ways with them, never to be seen again. We exchange stories, in the rare case a phone number or email. However, a majority of the time, their contact information sits there collecting dust, the only digital artifact of them from a sea of people, never to be contacted again.
