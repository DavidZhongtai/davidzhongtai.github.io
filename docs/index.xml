      <description>Scaling NoSQL Databases: A Primer In today&amp;rsquo;s day and age, organizations have more data than ever. On a smaller scale, developers are building startups serving large amounts of data to customers. All of these use cases require both the efficient storage and transmission of data. If a backend database goes down, a service can&amp;rsquo;t be used, customers can&amp;rsquo;t reach their app, and a myriad of issues appear.
To accommodate for this ever-growing thirst for data, many techniques have been developed to help address these issues.</description>

      <description>Understanding Kubernetes Security: A Comprehensive Review Kubernetes is now widely used for managing containerized applications. As more organizations adopt it, understanding its security aspects becomes crucial. This paper examines the key security challenges in Kubernetes and suggests ways to address them.
Basic Concepts of Kubernetes Security Kubernetes operates across many computers, often in different locations. This spread-out nature makes security more complex. Kubernetes also constantly creates and removes small units of work called pods.</description>

      <description>Guide to Research Park (v1.0) Why Did We Make This? We created this guide to address the growing interest in Research Park and the companies within. Recently, there has been an increased interest in all aspects of Research Park, from working there to internships, and even attending various sponsored events. However, getting involved may seem daunting at some times for students. This guide is to help anyone navigate the internship process, as well as offer advice to hopefully landing an opportunity at Research Park!</description>

      <description>How I Made This Site (And You Can Too!) This article is part one of a two-article series. In the first part, we will focus on setting up the bare basics of how to set up a site and creating articles to view for yourself. In the second part, we focus on the basics of deploying it for the whole internet to see. Throughout the articles, we try to make it as easy as possible, so anyone without a heavy technical background can set one up themselves.</description>

Recently I had the opportunity to help run UIUCTF 2023, a student-run capture the flag (CTF) event with some awesome folk in SIGPwny. The part I worked on mainly centered around open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. In this post, we go over some solutions to the OSINT suite as some tips and tricks to approaching these challenges in CTFs.</description>

Technical Books The DevOps Handbook, Gene Kim and Others
Kim&#39;s DevOps Handbook presents itself as a solid guide to get a comprehensive understanding of the state of DevOps. The book presents itself as a wide variety of topics with real case studies baked into each chapter. While it doesn&#39;t get into the specifics, it builds a great overall understanding and allows the reader to gain an understanding of the landscape of devops.</description>

      <description>FaDe-Net [Writeup] David An - AP Research Project
Abstract The rapid development of social media and online news outlets has accelerated the spread of fake news across the internet. The accessibility and convenience of social media has further driven the drastic change of information consumption. As a consequence, fake news has become a significant concern because of 1) its inevitable exposure to large populations and 2) the potential to cause significant damage in modern society.</description>

      <description>Building an NLP-Powered Repository for Cyber Risk Literature [Poster] David An, Linfeng Zheng, Zhiyu (Frank) Quan
Abstract With the large and growing body of cyber risk literature, we see three major challenges faced by the actuarial research community: there is no context aware tool for finding cyber literature, no central repository of cyber risk resources, and a lack of accounting of literature trends. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose to build a repository of cyber-risk articles with an NLP powered search tool that can easily be used by researchers to find relevant materials.</description>

      <description>Scraping Web Data for Academic Literature Done in collaboration with Dr. Emiliano Valdez1, University of Connecticut
Goals How obvious are actual trends in academic literature and how can we easily gather academic literature metadata? The purpose of the exploratory study was to develop and analyze different methods of data retrieval from multiple sources.
Given a text search within context, we should be able to retrieve a list of articles that contain that segment of text.</description>

      <description>3,000 Miles of Solitude The streets are empty with the streetlights being the only company in the morning. Wet, damp fog provide the only relief in what is projected to be another scorching day when the sun comes up. I can&amp;rsquo;t see the crows screeching into the dawn, but I can hear them singing their song.
It&amp;rsquo;s July in central Illinois. I lace up my white bike cleats, marred with grease marks and mud and clip into my bike; providing a stark contrast to the hot-rod red paint job of my carbon fiber contraptions.</description>

      <description>A Semester of Research All of this comes together for a Fake Detection Network, or FaDe-Net. In order to validate and benchmark our results, we performed a series of metric tests on the MIT Fake News Dataset1 and achieved a precision rate of 90.31% as well as an accuracy rate of 88.56%. Our experiments indicate the model is more effective at fake news detection. However, this model still has a significant amount of room to improve in future research.</description>

      <description>I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign with a B.S. in Mathematics, finishing my degree in two years (2021-2023). During that time, I organized and hosted many events catered to undergraduates in the topics of recruiting, job search, and extracurriculars. I enjoy traveling to mentor and judge hackathons at different universities while continuing to give workshops and talks around the East Coast. I tinker with large database systems, text mining, and computer security in my spare time.</description>

These are the same words I hear every Friday morning from the woman behind the counter. Her eyes weary from the same cycle day over day; something that has become a habit over years of monotony. However, it‚Äôs not her which gives the donut shop the character it possesses; instead, it‚Äôs moreso the cacophony of hearing the ovens blaring, cash registers ringing, and blenders blending which gives this donut shop its character.</description>

      <description>Jenkins Security Vulnerability Writeup So, how does it begin? After getting bored one day and browsing Shodan.io, one wonders what&amp;rsquo;s the worst that you can find on there? Turns out, the answer led to a 2-day bender down different rabbit holes eventually leading to this article here and a lot of vulnerabilities discovered. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started shall we?

While alot has gone on, there will definitely be a steady catch up of content that has been written but not yet uploaded. After settling down and moving, there should be much more time to write. In lieu of that however, there has been alot of time to do cool things and catch up with people since then.</description>

      <description>1 Month and 7 Cities Later Flights start blending together one after one. Washington D.C. used to seem like a world away but now is a quick afternoon drive. Early morning drives to the airport only to make it through security before the sun rises and the Dunkin&amp;rsquo; opens. Paying an inexcusable $4.18 for a 16oz. bottle of water, only to down it moments later.
Those lines have described the past month making my way around the east coast.</description>

      <description>A Discussion on Pandas and Data Mining At the beginning of any data analytics/data science project, the most usual case is utilizing Pandas to load the data into a object called a DataFrame and perform preprocessing tasks on it. While the Pandas library is convenient and comes with a trove of useful analytic tools, it does have some inefficiencies, many due to the nature of Python. To investigate this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how Pandas actually works on top of Python.</description>
