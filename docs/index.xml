      <description>Donuts &amp;ldquo;$7.13 is your total sir.&amp;rdquo;
These are the same words I hear every Friday morning from the woman behind the counter. Her eyes weary from the same cycle day over day; something that has become a habit over years of monotony. However, it‚Äôs not her which gives the donut shop the character it possesses; instead, it‚Äôs moreso the cacophony of hearing the ovens blaring, cash registers ringing, and blenders blending which gives this donut shop its character.</description>

      <description>A Semester of Research All of this comes together for a Fake Detection Network, or FaDe-Net. In order to validate and benchmark our results, we performed a series of metric tests on the MIT Fake News Dataset1 and achieved a precision rate of 90.31% as well as an accuracy rate of 88.56%. Our experiments indicate the model is more effective at fake news detection. However, this model still has a significant amount of room to improve in future research.</description>

      <description>Unification in Academic Literature Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and acheive, and contribute to improving our quality of life -Sidney Sheldon
Chaos is always present. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s in the weather or in crowds, things always tend to be in disarray. The same can be said for data storage and retrieval systems as well.
The concept of data is odd.</description>

      <description>FaDe-Net [Writeup] David An - AP Research Project
Abstract The rapid development of social media and online news outlets has accelerated the spread of fake news across the internet. The accessibility and convenience of social media has further driven the drastic change of information consumption. As a consequence, fake news has become a significant concern because of 1) its inevitable exposure to large populations and 2) the potential to cause significant damage in modern society.</description>

      <description>Building an NLP-Powered Repository for Cyber Risk Literature [Poster] David An, Linfeng Zheng, Zhiyu (Frank) Quan
Abstract With the large and growing body of cyber risk literature, we see three major challenges faced by the actuarial research community: there is no context aware tool for finding cyber literature, no central repository of cyber risk resources, and a lack of accounting of literature trends. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose to build a repository of cyber-risk articles with an NLP powered search tool that can easily be used by researchers to find relevant materials.</description>

      <description>Scraping Web Data for Academic Literature Done in collaboration with Dr. Emiliano Valdez1, University of Connecticut
Goals How obvious are actual trends in academic literature and how can we easily gather academic literature metadata? The purpose of the exploratory study was to develop and analyze different methods of data retrieval from multiple sources.
Given a text search within context, we should be able to retrieve a list of articles that contain that segment of text.</description>
