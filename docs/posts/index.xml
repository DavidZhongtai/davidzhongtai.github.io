      <description>UIUCTF23 Challenge Writeups! A long overdue set of writeups (solutions) for UIUCTF23. Recently I had the opportunity to help run UIUCTF 2023, a student-run capture the flag (CTF) event with some awesome folk in SIGPwny. The part I worked on mainly centered around open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. In this post, we go over some solutions to the OSINT suite as some tips and tricks to approaching these challenges in CTFs.</description>

      <description>3,000 Miles of Solitude The streets are empty with the streetlights being the only company in the morning. Wet, damp fog provide the only relief in what is projected to be another scorching day when the sun comes up. I can&amp;rsquo;t see the crows screeching into the dawn, but I can hear them singing their song.
It&amp;rsquo;s July in central Illinois. I lace up my white bike cleats, marred with grease marks and mud and clip into my bike; providing a stark contrast to the hot-rod red paint job of my carbon fiber contraptions.</description>

      <description>A Semester of Research All of this comes together for a Fake Detection Network, or FaDe-Net. In order to validate and benchmark our results, we performed a series of metric tests on the MIT Fake News Dataset1 and achieved a precision rate of 90.31% as well as an accuracy rate of 88.56%. Our experiments indicate the model is more effective at fake news detection. However, this model still has a significant amount of room to improve in future research.</description>

      <description>Donuts &amp;ldquo;$7.13 is your total sir.&amp;rdquo;
These are the same words I hear every Friday morning from the woman behind the counter. Her eyes weary from the same cycle day over day; something that has become a habit over years of monotony. However, it’s not her which gives the donut shop the character it possesses; instead, it’s moreso the cacophony of hearing the ovens blaring, cash registers ringing, and blenders blending which gives this donut shop its character.</description>

      <description>Inequality Fun and Their Applications This article assumes the reader has basic knowledge of calculus and analysis. Covers topics ranging from basic Cauchy Schwarz to Lipschitz, culminating in us pulling out a mathematical rabbit out of an algebraic hat.
1. What is an Inequality? An inequality compares two values, showing if one is less than, greater than, or simply not equal to another value. Literally, it does not get more simpler than that.</description>

      <description>A (Fun) Discussion on Harmonic Functions Some introductions into harmonic functions. This post is meant to be an approchable read into these phenomena.
1. Introduction on Harmonic Functions A mass on a spring, measuring fluid flow, even the cosine wave, are all examples of where harmonic functions can be found within our world. The name itself stems from an object or force going through some type of harmonic (or oscillating) motion from a steady state equilibrium.</description>

      <description>Jenkins Security Vulnerability Writeup So, how does it begin? After getting bored one day and browsing Shodan.io, one wonders what&amp;rsquo;s the worst that you can find on there? Turns out, the answer led to a 2-day bender down different rabbit holes eventually leading to this article here and a lot of vulnerabilities discovered. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started shall we?
Before we do this, I do not endorse attempting to break into company systems.</description>

      <description>Life For the Past 3 Months It&amp;rsquo;s been 2.5 months since I graduated, and approximately 3-ish months since the last computer or mathematical related post. While alot has gone on, there will definitely be a steady catch up of content that has been written but not yet uploaded. After settling down and moving, there should be much more time to write. In lieu of that however, there has been alot of time to do cool things and catch up with people since then.</description>

      <description>The Influence of Lunch Items on Cryptocurrency in the United States *This post is pending for SIGBOVIK 0x7e7*
For some background information, SIGBOVIK is a yearly scientific conference hosted by Carnegie Mellon University where participants are able to flex their lesser-known research muscles. These are the dank-memers of academia.
Abstract In this paper, we introduce the discovery and exploration of the influence of common every day lunch items on cryptocurrency trends.</description>

      <description>A Discussion on Pandas and Data Mining At the beginning of any data analytics/data science project, the most usual case is utilizing Pandas to load the data into a object called a DataFrame and perform preprocessing tasks on it. While the Pandas library is convenient and comes with a trove of useful analytic tools, it does have some inefficiencies, many due to the nature of Python. To investigate this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how Pandas actually works on top of Python.</description>

      <description>Unification in Academic Literature Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and acheive, and contribute to improving our quality of life -Sidney Sheldon
Chaos is always present. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s in the weather or in crowds, things always tend to be in disarray. The same can be said for data storage and retrieval systems as well.
The concept of data is odd.</description>
