<p>Flights start blending together one after one. Washington D.C. used to seem like a world away but now is a quick afternoon drive. Early morning drives to the airport only to make it through security before the sun rises and the Dunkin&rsquo; opens. A mad scramble to the front of the line when boarding starts, all to claim the best overhead bin space.</p>
<p>Those lines have described the past month making my way around the east coast. I really should have been home, but something in me can&rsquo;t just stay in one place at a time. Many of the stops were to revisit old spots and friends.</p>
<p>A stop at Stamford to revisit memories made during summer, another in NYC to spend time with family on Labor Day, and a quick jaunt around Back Bay&ndash;an upscale area in a part of downtown Boston. Feeling the train slow down, I haul my suitcase down from the overhead compartment. Covered in dents, scratches, and grease marks, the silver of the suitcase looks as sleek as ever in the afternoon sunlight as I make my way to the airport.</p>
<p>Boarding a plane in DC, I&rsquo;m currently on my way to Illinois to visit some college friends. Having been on the road for 7 days already, the glamour of perpetual travel has started to wear off a bit as I long for a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p>Since graduating from college in May, I suddenly find myself with an abundance of time. Class schedules no longer exist, leaving a void in a what-used-to be orderly day-to-day schedule. From 9 to 5, I envelop myself in work, oblivious to what is going on outside. From 5 to 9, I make my way over to the late night burger joint, or an Amtrak, going hundreds of miles away from where I currently am. Many people talk about settling down or taking a break after college, and I ask myself why I haven&rsquo;t done the same.</p>
<p>The flight attendants start the ritual of going around, checking everyone&rsquo;s seatbelts, and making sure devices are put into airplane mode. Shortly after, we take off. Some small talk with my seatmate and we both settle in our own rhythms and business.</p>
<p>At first, going solo into a large airport is intimidating with not much room for thought; the only one thought being how to get to the destination. Subsequent trips become much easier. TSA goes from being a scary entity to being a minor inconvenience to get through. You learn to embrace the tradition of scarfing down Mickey-D&rsquo;s right before a flight or scrambling to catch a last-minute gate change.</p>
<p>Traveling by air, rail, road, you tend to encounter a wide variety of people and perspectives. There&rsquo;s something unique about meeting someone for a few hours and then parting ways with them, never to be seen again. We exchange stories, in the rare case a phone number or email. However, a majority of the time, their contact information sits there collecting dust, the only digital artifact of them from a sea of people, never to be contacted again.</p>
