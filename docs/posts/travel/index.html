    <h1 id="1-month-and-7-cities-later">1 Month and 7 Cities Later</h1>
<p>Flights start blending together one after one. Washington D.C. used to seem like a world away but now is a quick afternoon drive. Early morning drives to the airport only to make it through security before the sun rises and the Dunkin&rsquo; opens. Paying an inexcusable $4.18 for a 16oz. bottle of water, only to down it moments later.</p>
<p>Those lines have described the past month making my way around the east coast. I really should have been home, but something in me can&rsquo;t just stay in one place at a time, constantly having the need to move around from place to place, not staying for more than three days in a city.</p>
<p>A stop at Stamford to revisit memories made during summer, another in NYC to spend time with family on Labor Day, and a quick jaunt around Back Bay&ndash;an upscale area in a part of downtown Boston. Feeling the train slow down, I haul my suitcase down from the overhead compartment. Covered in dents, scratches, and grease marks, the silver of the suitcase looks as sleek as ever in the afternoon sunlight as I make my way to the airport.</p>
<p><strong><p style="text-align: center; padding: 25px;">&ldquo;Boarding groups 1 and 2 may make their way to the gate now&rdquo;</p></strong></p>
<p>A mad scramble ensues to the front of the line when boarding starts, all to claim the best overhead bin space. Boarding a plane in DC, I&rsquo;m currently on my way to Illinois to visit some college friends. Having been on the road for 7 days already, the glamour of perpetual travel has started to wear off a bit as I long for a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p>Since graduating from college in May, I suddenly find myself with an abundance of time. Class schedules no longer exist, leaving a void in a what-used-to be orderly day-to-day schedule. From 9 to 5, I envelop myself in work, oblivious to what is going on outside. From 5 to 9, I make my way over to the late night burger joint, or an Amtrak, going hundreds of miles away from where I currently am. Many people talk about settling down or taking a break after college, and I ask myself why I haven&rsquo;t done the same.</p>
<p>The flight attendants start the ritual of going around, checking everyone&rsquo;s seatbelts, and making sure devices are put into airplane mode. Shortly after, we take off. Some small talk with my seatmate and we both settle in our own rhythms and business.</p>
<p>At first, going solo into a large airport is intimidating with not much room for thought; the only one thought being how to get to the destination. Subsequent trips become much easier. TSA goes from being a scary entity to being a minor inconvenience to get through. You learn to embrace the tradition of scarfing down Mickey-D&rsquo;s right before a flight or scrambling to catch a last-minute gate change.</p>
<p>Traveling by air, rail, road, you tend to encounter a wide variety of people and perspectives. There&rsquo;s something unique about meeting someone for a few hours and then parting ways with them, never to be seen again. We exchange stories, in the rare case a phone number or email. However, a majority of the time, their contact information sits there collecting dust, the only digital artifact of them from a sea of people, never to be contacted again.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t forget your firsts when traveling. The first time you experience the rush of the plane taking off, the first road trip, the first &ldquo;Welcome to [insert state]&rdquo; sign you see on a road trip. As the years go by, these firsts become memories in an ever-growing tapestry of travel memories&ndash;a tapestry where each experience is it&rsquo;s own unique hue&ndash;culminating into a beautiful work of art. The thrill of takeoff might become routine, but it never loses its magic entirely.</p>
<p><strong><p style="text-align: center; padding: 25px;">&ldquo;Please put your electronic devices away and your seat trays up as we prepare for landing in Chicago&rdquo;</p></strong></p>
<p>Through travel, I&rsquo;ve picked up some uncanny abilities. I can now pack an entire week&rsquo;s of clothes inside a backpack. I can figure out how to time my meals in transit. Even if that means taking an 10 AM &ldquo;lunch&rdquo; before a 6-hour flight at 11 AM. There&rsquo;s also the unexpected moments. A cancelled flight leaving you in an unknown city, late night conversations with strangers in the back of a train, or the impromptu boba at midnight with a group of recently made friends.</p>
<p>During my first year of college, I have only truly felt free. Growing up in Western PA, there was only so much you can do, people to see, and places to visit. A &ldquo;night out&rdquo; consisted of going out to the local Target only to end up in a random parking lot, reminiscing about memories and dancing to music in the parking lot, toes dancing over the painted white lines. Only until I forayed into the Midwest have I realized the excitement of changing scenes, leaving the familiar behind, and venturing into the unknown.</p>
<p>As the wheels touch the ground, I realize that the tapestry of travel is constantly being reworked. Every stitch, twist, and turn adds complexity and depth to the overall composition. The journey is not merely a passage from one point to another; it is an ongoing masterpiece, crafted by the experiences and stories that unfold with every step.</p>
<p>Stepping off the plane, I wonder of what will become of this tapestry.</p>
